The Gokli contract is an ERC20 token airdrop smart contract. It allows the contract owner to distribute tokens to multiple addresses in a single transaction. Here's a breakdown of the contract and how you can interact with it:

Contract Overview:
Libraries:

SafeMath: Library for safe arithmetic operations.
SafeERC20: Library for safe ERC20 token operations.
Address: Library for address-related operations.
Interface:

IERC20: Interface for ERC20 token functions.
Contract Functionality:

doOKPowerSend: Main function for token distribution.
Accepts an ERC20 token address, an array of recipient addresses, and an array of token values to send to each address.
Loops through the recipient addresses and sends the corresponding token value to each address.
The function is external, allowing anyone to call it and trigger the token distribution.
Interacting with the Contract:
To distribute tokens using the Gokli contract, you would follow these steps:

Deploy the Gokli contract, passing the ERC20 token address as a constructor argument.
Call the doOKPowerSend function, providing the ERC20 token instance, an array of recipient addresses, and an array of token values to distribute.
Ensure that the caller of the doOKPowerSend function has approved the Gokli contract to transfer tokens on its behalf by calling approve on the ERC20 token contract.
Variables for Frontend Implementation:
To implement a frontend for interacting with this contract, you would need to provide input fields for the following:

ERC20 token address
Array of recipient addresses
Array of corresponding token values
Button to trigger the token distribution

In summary, the Gokli contract simplifies the process of distributing ERC20 tokens to multiple addresses efficiently in a single transaction.
